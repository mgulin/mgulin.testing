Testing repository
The idea behind this is to have an script to allow sync between one central git repository and several FTP sites where the deployed code is running.
Due to low developing time this is going to be done in one and only one script: it will store the code and also the info about projects, branches
and sites.

You can have several projects to keep in sync, and every project will have one or several branches to keep track of. Every branch will have info about
its FTP account (host, user and pass).
The script will be in charge of periodically questioning the central git repo about the last commit on branches it manage. If the last commit on a
branch it's newer than the last one uploaded through FTP the script will take care of uploading the new version.

The script will run through cron at predefined intervals.
